Nerites is my Building AI course project

## Summary

Nerites is an ideation of  a motion sensor IoT based  system designed to act as a non face-to-face complement for care services  in the dwellings.It is intended as an slow care solution with a non intrussive approach for caregivers and family.

## Background

In recent years, the importance of telecare solutions for the elderly, frail, dependent and living alone people has been demonstrated. The study of their habits, mobility patterns and home behavior through sensorization can offer solutions not only in response to emergencies but in improving  ambient assisted living strategies and home contexts analysis using AI. The pandemic scenario has demonstrated the need to strengthen telecare, telemonitoring and intelligent telecare systems in the current scenario.

## How is it used?

The system should be intended as a non face-to face complement for caregivers services and family suppport in the users dwelllings via cloud plattform with user alerts, reminders,notifications and reports implemented and accesible via connected devices

## Data sources and AI methods

The data sources are going to be the events of a motion sensor IoT based system and the main techniques are going to be unsupervised machine learning techniques in the initial steps and supervised machine learning techniques after that, once identified the different user persona profiles and their habitual behaviours

## Challenges

The challenge is to become a non-intrusive monitoring system that offers tranquility, support and security to the elderly, frail, dependent or living alone people so that they can continue to live in the most autonomous way possible in their homes and usual environments. 

## What next?

The project can grow in two ways to become even more complete: with our data análysis we can refine our results to establish and alert system in case of a detected pattern distortion and we can design a cognitive system that predicts future user behaviours.The future of the past is the future of the future.


## Acknowledgments

The idea it is intended to become an AI evolution of Nerea Care, an innovative non face-to-face motion sensor IoT based system with a non intrussive approach designed by the basque service design and consulting agency Alda2U.I’m currently working in the company as a consultant and advisor
